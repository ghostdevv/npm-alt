# Contributing

Patches are very much welcome, all I ask is that the bigger ones are discussed first in an issue.

To get the repo running locally, you'll need Node 22/24 and pnpm 10 (a tool that understands `packageManager` like corepack/volta is recommended).

1. Run `pnpm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.
3. Success! `pnpm dev` time.

Commits will use a conventional commit style, but since PRs will usually be squash merged, feel free to use a style that suits you - it'll be easily changed when the PR is merged.
